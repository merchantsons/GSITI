// 12# Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name,
//     print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized
//     with the person’s name.

let names: string[]=['Jeson','Robin','Chris','Ronin','jerry'];


// Loop for each message
for (let name of names) {
    console.log(`Hello and Good Evening ${name}, Welcome to our website Have Fun..`)
}
