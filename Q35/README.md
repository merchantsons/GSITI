Q#35. Animals: Think of at least three different animals that have a common characteristic.
               Store the names of these animals in a list, and then use a for loop to print
               out the name of each animal. • Modify your program to print a statement about
               each animal, such as A dog would make a great pet. • Add a line at the end of
               your program stating what these animals have in common. You could print a sentence
               such as Any of these animals would make a great pet!


Done.
