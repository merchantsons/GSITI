Q#38. Cities: Write a function called describe_city() that accepts the name of a city and its country.
      The function should print a simple sentence, such as Karachi is in Pakistan. Give the parameter 
      for the country a default value. Call your function for three different cities, at least one of
      which is not in the default country.



Done.
