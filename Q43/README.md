Q#43. Unchanged Magicians: Start with your work from Exercise 40. Call the function make_great()
      with a copy of the array of magicians’ names. Because the original array will be unchanged, 
      return the new array and store it in a separate array. Call show_magicians() with each array
      to show that you have one array of the original names and one array with the Great added to 
      each magician’s name.


Done.
